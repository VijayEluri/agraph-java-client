A Java API to the AllegroGraph triple store implementation.
<p>
We provide adapters for Sesame 2.x and Jena 2.5.
<h3>Compatibility Note</h3>
This Java API is similar to the AllegroGraph Java API in earlier releases (3.1.1 and older),
but it is significantly different in many details.  Existing Java programs will need to be
modified substantially.
<ul>
<li>The primary public package is <code>com.franz.agbase</code>
<li>New classes: ValueSetIterator, PrologSelectQuery
<li>All the methods in AllegroGraph for making Prolog queries have been 
eliminated in favor of the PrologSelectQuery class.
<li>The ValueObject class hierarchy is completely separate form Sesame classes. 
</ul>
